# lotus-wisdom-mcp

> A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server providing contemplative reasoning using the Lotus Sutra's wisdom framework.

## What This Is

An MCP tool called `lotuswisdom` that facilitates structured contemplation through wisdom domains. The tool processes your thinking internally and tracks your journey across different modes of understanding.

## How To Use

1. Begin with `tag='begin'` to receive the full framework (philosophy, domains, guidance)
2. Continue with contemplation tags: open, examine, direct, integrate, express, etc.
3. The tool returns journey tracking and domain movements
4. When `status='WISDOM_READY'` is returned, speak the final wisdom naturally in your own voice

## Wisdom Domains and Tags

- **Entry**: `begin` - Start here to receive framework
- **Process Flow**: `open`, `engage`, `express` - Natural arc of inquiry
- **Skillful Means**: `upaya`, `expedient`, `direct`, `gradual`, `sudden` - Different approaches to truth
- **Non-Dual Recognition**: `recognize`, `transform`, `integrate`, `transcend`, `embody` - Awakening to what's present
- **Meta-Cognitive**: `examine`, `reflect`, `verify`, `refine`, `complete` - Mind watching understanding unfold
- **Meditation**: `meditate` - Pause for insight to emerge

## Key Principles

- Tags are not rigid steps but aspects of wisdom that interpenetrate
- Each step contains all others - recognition IS transformation
- Trust what each moment calls for; the path reveals itself in walking
- The tool handles contemplation; you handle expression

## When To Use

- Complex problems requiring multi-perspective understanding
- Questions where contradictions need integration
- Situations needing both analytical and intuitive understanding
- Problems that benefit from meditative pauses
- Questions containing their own inherent wisdom
